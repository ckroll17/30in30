# JavaScript 30

### Day 1
Day one I was tasked with building a type of drumkit using keystrokes. I have found that it is quite helpful to fully watch the video through, then restart and follow along.
I did not modify much of the coding on this project as I am getting my feet wet and wanted to follow along, however, it has inspired some ideas for future projects.

### Day 2
I fell behind and before I knew I hadn't completed day two yet, and its now day three. I will double up soon to catch up and get back on track.
Day two I built a functioning clock using JS. I did have to watch the video a couple times to fully see what he was working on, and discovered that a portion of the hours code was missing from the tutorial. Once I was able to troubleshoot that, I had a clock that was working perfectly.
I did decide to play with the esthetics of this one. I modified the background image, changed the css color styles, added a clock face, and gave the clock an opaque background color.
I had a lot of fun with day two.

## Day 3
Today, the project was working with CSS and Javascript together. This is fun stuff. Knowing the power of CSS and handing some of the control over to JavaScript is a powerful tool, and expands options, and opens creative doors.

## Day 4
Ok, so I've kinda dropped the ball on this one. I did start it and plan to finish it, but time as been moving fast, and I am falling behind, so I'm going to have to come back to this one.

## Day 5
This is one of my favorites so far because it is giving me ideas for my own site.
This project was building out an image gallery using Flex in CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to check it out on github or on my codepen.

## Day 6

I am going to rewatch this one a few times. I liked it, but it felt like it was moving a little fast for me. I am hungry, so I'm keeping that in mind as I struggle to keep up with it. The type ahead can come in handy for so many things, I think this is a good thing to not only learn, but also really know.
Sometimes, the afterthoughts and modifications mess with my mind, but it does all come toghether in the end. This is part of the reason I'm going to rewatch a few times.

## Day 7

Learning more about arrays and getting pumped to use more and more ES6. Kept the delete to a splice. Once I get stronger with ES6, I'll come back and change this to ES6 syntax.
