# JavaScript 30

### Day 1
Day one I was tasked with building a type of drumkit using keystrokes. I have found that it is quite helpful to fully watch the video through, then restart and follow along.
I did not modify much of the coding on this project as I am getting my feet wet and wanted to follow along, however, it has inspired some ideas for future projects.

### Day 2
I fell behind and before I knew I hadn't completed day two yet, and its now day three. I will double up soon to catch up and get back on track.
Day two I built a functioning clock using JS. I did have to watch the video a couple times to fully see what he was working on, and discovered that a portion of the hours code was missing from the tutorial. Once I was able to troubleshoot that, I had a clock that was working perfectly.
I did decide to play with the esthetics of this one. I modified the background image, changed the css color styles, added a clock face, and gave the clock an opaque background color.
I had a lot of fun with day two.

## Day 3
Today, the project was working with CSS and Javascript together. This is fun stuff. Knowing the power of CSS and handing some of the control over to JavaScript is a powerful tool, and expands options, and opens creative doors.
