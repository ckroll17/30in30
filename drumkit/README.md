# Drumkit 101
### Playing drums using the Keyboard

In this first day of JavaScript projects, we reviewed how to implement some JavaScript to make each key play a different sound. Using data-keys assigned to each keycode to the sounds makes day 1 a few lines of code to produce a lot of fun.

This project opens the door to changing and modifying with endless possibilities.
